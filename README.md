# SAHA Project – Spatial Atlas of Human Anatomy

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the **Spatial Atlas of Human Anatomy (SAHA)**, a multimodal reference of human tissues at subcellular resolution. We develop and release high-resolution spatial omics datasets, computational tools, and benchmarks to enable tissue-scale systems biology and clinical translation. 

The SAHA project brings together spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, histology, and AI-based computational methods to chart the healthy and diseased human body in unprecedented detail.
- Subcellular-resolution spatial profiling across gastrointestinal and immune tissues  
- Multi-modal datasets: CosMx SMI, MERFISH, spatial proteomics, histology, and clinical metadata  
- Applications in cancer, inflammation, and tissue microenvironment modeling  
- Open science collaboration across institutions
